# MovieScriptWriter
Natural Language Processing (NLP) of movie transcripts based off profits to generate new genre-specific movie transcripts using GPT2-medium model machine learning.





Examples of generated movie scripts can be seen below from the 3 different movie genres' (Adventure, Action and Comedy) data that the NLP model was trained on:

This code was done and graded as a group project for MS0003 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) where I received an overall A+ grade for this module. My contributions to this project included:

1. Coded overall code for NLP model training and implementation
2. Performed essential transcript cleaning
